One of my favourite projects that I have done so far. My team and I did a project on IT1244 NUS (Artificial Intelligence) and we selected the MNIST clothing detection.

The skeleton of the project is derived from the [tensorflow website](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification).

Edits we made to improve on existing code:
- data preprocessing
    - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    - Edge Detection
- improving Convolution Neural Network(CNN) model
    - Used Mini VGGNET to do deeper learning
    - Did lots of cross-comparison with accuracy and time to see the *best* model
